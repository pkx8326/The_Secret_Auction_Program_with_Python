# The_Secret_Auction_Program_with_Python
This simple program 'secretly' takes names and bidding values from each bidder and announce the auction winner after the user declare that there's no more next bidder. This program makes use of dictionary, for-loop, and simple comparison algorithm to get the information about the highest bidder. In the end, the name and the bidding value of the highest bidder will be displayed.

This program was inspired by a lesson in the "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp 2022" by Angela Yu on Udemy. You can check the following link (not a ref. link) for the course: https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/
